The Mappings_informationEntropy includes a simple example of computational work undertaken at ICFO during 2021-2022 academic year.

It considers Jodran-Wigner, Parity and Braviy-Kitaev fermion to qubit mappings. For several fermionic systems (H2,HF,BH3,BeH2,N2) computes the corresponding qubit hamiltonian, it diagonalizes it to find the ground state, and computes such ground state entanglement with Von-Neumann's entropy. This program is able to check the effect of the mapping used in a quantum simulation, in terms of the entanglement entropy affecting a quantum circuit's depth.
